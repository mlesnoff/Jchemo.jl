QDA on PLS latent variables (PLS-QDA) with continuum.
* `X` : X-data (n, p).
* `y` : Univariate class membership (n).
* `weights` : Weights (n) of the observations. 
    Must be of type `Weight` (see e.g. function `mweight`).
Keyword arguments:
* `nlv` : Nb. latent variables (LVs) to compute.
    Must be >= 1.
* `prior` : Type of prior probabilities for class 
    membership. Possible values are: `:unif` (uniform), 
    `:prop` (proportional), or a vector (of length equal to 
    the number of classes) giving the prior weight for each class 
    (in case of vector, it must be sorted in the same order as `mlev(y)`).
* `alpha` : Scalar (âˆˆ [0, 1]) defining the continuum
    between QDA (`alpha = 0`) and LDA (`alpha = 1`).
* `scal` : Boolean. If `true`, each column of `X` 
    and Ydummy is scaled by its uncorrected standard deviation
    in the PLS computation.

QDA on PLS latent variables:
1) The training variable `y` (univariate class membership) is 
    transformed to a dummy table (Ydummy) containing nlev columns, where 
    nlev is the number of classes present in `y`. Each column of Ydummy 
    is a dummy (0/1) variable. 
2) A weighted multivariate PLS ("PLS2") is run on {`X`, Ydummy}, returning 
    a score matrix `T`.
3) A QDA (possibly with continuum) is done on {`T`, `y`}. 

See functions `qda` and `plslda` for details (arguments `weights`, `prior` 
and `alpha`) and examples.
