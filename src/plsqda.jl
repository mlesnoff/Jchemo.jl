PLS-QDA (with continuum towards PLS-LDA).
* `X` : X-data.
* `y` : y-data (class membership).
* `weights` : Weights of the observations. 
    Internally normalized to sum to 1. 
* `nlv` : Nb. latent variables (LVs) to compute.
* `alpha` : Scalar (âˆˆ [0, 1]) defining the continuum
    between QDA (`alpha = 0`; default) and LDA (`alpha = 1`).
* `prior` : Type of prior probabilities for class membership.
    Posible values are: "unif" (uniform), "prop" (proportional).
* `scal` : Boolean. If `true`, each column of `X` 
    is scaled by its uncorrected standard deviation.

QDA on PLS latent variables. 

The training variable `y` (univariate class membership) is transformed
to a dummy table (Ydummy) containing nlev columns, where nlev is the number 
of classes present in `y`. Each column of Ydummy is a dummy variable (0/1). 
Then, a PLS2 is implemented on `X` and Ydummy, 
returning `nlv` latent variables (LVs). Finally, a QDA is run on these LVs and `y`.

See `?plslda` for examples.
