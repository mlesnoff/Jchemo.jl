    segmkf(n, K; rep = 1)
    segmkf(n, K, group; rep = 1)
Build segments for K-fold cross-validation.  
* `n` : Total nb. observations in the dataset. The sampling 
    is implemented with 1:n.
* `K` : Nb. folds (segments) splitting the data. 
* `group` : A vector (n) defining blocks.
* `rep` : Nb. replications of the sampling.

Build K segments splitting the data that can be used to validate a model. 
The sampling can be replicated (`rep`).

If `group` is used (must be a vector of length n), the function samples entire 
blocks of observations instead of observations. Such a block-sampling is required 
when data is structured by blocks and when the response to predict is 
correlated within blocks. It prevents underestimation of the generalization error.

The function returns a list (vector) of `rep` elements. 
Each element of the list contains `K` segments (= `K` vectors).
Each segment contains the indexes (position within 1:`n`) of the sampled observations.    

## Examples
```julia
n = 10 ; K = 3 ; rep = 4 
segm = segmkf(n, K; rep) 
i = 1 
segm[i] # = replication "i"

# Block-sampling

n = 11 
group = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "A"]    # = blocks of the observations
unique(group)   
K = 3 ; rep = 4 
segm = segmkf(n, K, group; rep = rep)
i = 1 
segm[i]
group[segm[i][1]]
group[segm[i][2]]
group[segm[i][3]]

Build segments for "test-set" validation.
* `n` : Total nb. observations in the dataset. The sampling 
    is implemented within 1:`n`.
* `m` : Nb. observations, or groups (if `group` is used), returned in each segment.
* `seed` : Can set the seet for the `Random.MersenneTwister` generator. 
    Must be of length = `rep`. When `nothing`, the seed is random at each sampling.
* `group` : A vector (n) defining blocks of observations.
* `rep` : Nb. replications of the sampling.
