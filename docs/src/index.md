Documentation for [Jchemo.jl](https://github.com/mlesnoff/Jchemo.jl).

## Overview

**Jchemo** provides elementary functions and pipelines for predictions in chemometrics or other domains. It mainly focuses on methods for high dimensional data. 

Generic functions such as **transform**, **predict**, **coef** and **summary** are available. Tuning the models is facilitated by functions **gridscore** (validation dataset) and **gridcv** (cross-validation), in addition to faster versions for models based on latent variables (LVs) (**gridscorelv** and **gridcvlv**) and ridge regularization (**gridscorelb** and **gridcvlb**).

The package is under construction. Functions may change in the future.
